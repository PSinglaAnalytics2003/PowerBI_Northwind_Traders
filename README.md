# PowerBI_Northwind_Traders
I have created reports based on Sales & order data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious gourmet food supplier, including information on customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees.

INSIGHTS

SALES-

Here I used KPI's to show Total Sales, Total Quantity, Average Sales Per Order and used Measures to calculate the values
To filter the data, I have used Slicers for Year and Month
Total sales Area Chart can be drilled down to Year, Month and Quarter
Used the clustered column chart to compare the current Year Sales to Previous Year Sales
Build Date Table to perform Time Intelligence functions
Create Map to show Total Sales divided in the countries
Compared Total Orders vs Total Sales by Month and line and column chart
