# PowerBI_Northwind_Traders
I have created reports based on Sales & order data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious gourmet food supplier, including information on customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees.

# INSIGHTS

# SALES
   1. Here I used card's to show Total Sales, Total Quantity, Average Sales Per Order and used Measures to calculate the values.
   2. To filter the data, I have used Slicers for Year and Month.
   3. Total sales Area Chart can be drilled down to Year, Month and Quarter.
   4. Used the clustered column chart to compare the current Year Sales to Previous Year Sales.
   5. Build Date Table to perform Time Intelligence functions.
   6. Create Map to show Total Sales divided in the countries.
   7. Compared Total Orders vs Total Sales by Month and line and column chart.
